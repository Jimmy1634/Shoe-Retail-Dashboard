#  Women's Shoe Sales Dashboard ‚Äì Personal Power BI Project

This Power BI dashboard analyzes sales performance from a dataset of a women's shoe company, providing valuable insights into product trends, regional performance, and revenue generation. This is my first attempt at dashboard design and development as I applied the fundamental skills and practices learned from passing the PL-300. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to clean, model, and visualize data in a compelling and decision-supporting format.

- **Sales by City**: Visual comparison of quantity sold in Khobar, Jeddah, and Riyadh.
